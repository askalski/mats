This project was a work-in-progress implementation of automated Accessibility
Testing Suite for Firefox, created by Andrzej Skalski while working for Mozilla

The project was planned to be cross-platform, but it's development was paused
before any backends other than MSAA were implemented. If you are a software
developer who plans to continue the work, please feel free to mail me at 
"public a-t akuda d-o-t org".

Please see basic_documentation.txt for installation/usage instructions.
