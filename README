This project is a work-in-progress implementation of automated Accessibility Testing Suite for Firefox,
created by Andrzej Skalski, Mozilla

the code is not runnable yet, although some desing principles are already known:

there will be several platform-dependent test folders (test_*) containing python style unittests in sets
there might be a single cross-platform test directory for abstracted tests at some point

all configuration is to be placed in "config.ini" file, athough passing other alternative configuration files from commandline will be possible

mats_runner folder is planned to deliver class set that provides a Firefox runner with abstracted interaction interface, to the point it's possible. All platform dependent details will be exposed by fields nested in a main class.

The goal is to keep basic and common setup options as simple as possible, while allowing full platform-specific testing in separate subclasses.

During development I will primarly focus on MSAA tests for now.
