This project is a work-in-progress implementation of automated Accessibility Testing Suite for Firefox,
created by Andrzej Skalski, Mozilla

the code is not runnable yet, although some desing principles are already known:

there will be several platform-dependent test folders (test_*) containing python style unittests in sets
there might be a single cross-platform test directory for abstracted tests at some point

all configuration is to be placed in "config.ini" file, athough passing other alternative configuration files from commandline will be possible

mats_runner folder is planned to deliver class set that provides a Firefox runner with abstracted interaction interface, to the point it's possible. All platform dependent details will be exposed by fields nested in a main class.

The goal is to keep basic and common setup options as simple as possible, while allowing full platform-specific testing in separate subclasses.

During development I will primarly focus on MSAA tests for now.

The idea is that tests are run by python.unittest module

Requirements:
for all systems:
Firefox compiled with --enable-marionette and --enable-accessibility, and ENABLE_MARIONETTE=1 added to $MC/browser/confvars.sh file as described here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Marionette/Setup#Running_Marionette_on_Desktop_Firefox_or_B2G_Desktop_builds
mozbase (https://github.com/mozilla/mozbase)
marionette_client from mozbase (it does not install automatically for some reason) 

for Windows (unless ctypes error is fixed, only win32 is supported):
comtypes (easy_install comtypes)
ctypes (watch the OS version, http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ctypes/ctypes-win64/ contains win64 version)

note on ctypes:
win64 for python 2.5 works so far on windows 7 with python 2.7. It is possible to install it via easy_install, but either visual studio 2008 is necessary (set the environment path variable to point vcvarsall.bat, or just google) OR mingw. For mingw there is an open bug (-mno-mingw flag being dropped by recent gcc), workarouds are possible.

for Linux:
pyatspi
and probably some more I haven't discovered yet
