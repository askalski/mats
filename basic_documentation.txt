MatsRunner is a thread. It's life cycle is as follows:

1) it reads config file and asserts it's correct
2) it creates FirefoxThread, which wraps MozRunner
3) it waits for FirefoxThread to provide Firefox's PID, which is necessary for 4
4) it creates a system-specific Controller, which is a thread, and feeds it with FF's PID
5)
