There are (unfortunately) multiple threads in this project. Fortunately, they form a clear
call tree - each thread is constructed and destroyed by the same owner thread,
and ownership presents as follows:

MatsRunner - this is not a thread
	FirefoxThread
		(embeds Mozprocess stuff)
	MatsController
		system specific event listner, which is not necessarly a process
		
each thread exposes (along with obvious start() method) methods:
stop() - stops the thread, should be called only by thread owner
wait_for_ready() - waits until entry protocol of run() is finished, and thread object is
	ready to receive further commands
